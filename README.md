# d3-sheets-leaflet-layers
A blend of d3 and leaflet with a back layer, powered by Google Sheets.

Just some code to add a Leaflet tile layer to bind to a D3 map, roughly based on [Mike Bostock's](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet/#init) tutorial but with a few fixes for the latest leaflet. Also, powered by Google Sheets. Points and shaded map are both options.

# d3-sheets-leaflet-layers
A blend of d3 and leaflet with a back layer, powered by Google Sheets.

Just some code to add a Leaflet tile layer to bind to a D3 map, roughly based on [Mike Bostock's](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet/#init) tutorial but with a few fixes for the latest leaflet. Also, powered by Google Sheets, so [live-updating!](https://www.nj.com/news/2019/06/more-and-more-nj-towns-are-banning-plastic-bags-check-out-the-growing-list.html) You can also [feed a Google Form into the map](https://www.nj.com/news/2019/06/what-shore-beach-has-the-most-bennies-vote-and-see-our-live-map-of-the-results.html).

Two options here:
- Weed_map.js: Shaded (choropleth) map with options to color by a number or by a category. See example spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wLGxm54vkX2SZ27mIyk77AIMZQQ4QDpsS6E-UwvM2zw/edit?usp=sharing).
